# 2026-02-19 Ticket UI + mark spam

## Prompt

next feature I want to add is some UI on actual tickets that are powered by this plugin
Ideally I would like a label called Is Spam? and it shows a yes/no based on the score we determined - this means we need to persist the score with the ticket. Obviously this is only showing no normally since it would never have tickets with spam, but in test mode would be yes/no.
I also want it to be clickable and when clicked it pops up a window (similar to how collaborators works).
In the popup I would like to list each system which was used (i.e. SFS and SpamCheck) and what the score.
I also want a button called "This is spam"
When the "This is spam" button is clicked it does the following
1. Adds the email address to the Ban list that OS Ticket has normally
2. Deletes the ticket
