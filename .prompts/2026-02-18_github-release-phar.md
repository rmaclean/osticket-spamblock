# 2026-02-18 GitHub release PHAR

## Prompt

we use github. can you add a github workflow which creates a release in the PHAR format for the plugin in this project. idea is to make it easy to install. Would be good to also add some notes to the readme for end consumers on how to get this (from releases) and install it
