# init

## Prompt

this is an empty folder for a project I want to start. it is an plugin for osticket I want to build 

the plugin is a spam check for any ticket created

I would like you to help me start it, to begin create any folder structure you think might be best for the code (we don't need code yet). Next setup a dockerfile for OSTicket so we can spin that up and test it. Then add an AGENTS.md with anything you, as an AI should know. Then add a README.md for humans to know and key aspects. Finally create a .prompts folder. In .prompts I want to store each prompt done; including this one (we can call it init.md)
