# 2026-02-21 Configurable blocked email log level

## Prompt

lets add a setting for that log message (and the non test version) to be logged at debug, warning, or error level

Added plugin setting `Blocked Email Log Level` (debug/warning/error) to control the level used for:
- `Spamblock - Blocked Email`
- `Spamblock - Would have blocked Email`
