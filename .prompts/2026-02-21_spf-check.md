# 2026-02-21 SPF check provider

## Prompt

we have the domain name for the email address
we have the IP it was sent from
this means we could do a SPF check, right
so we need some extra config in the form of 3 drop downs
1 - SPF Check Fails: Do Nothing or Treat as Spam
2- SPF Record Missing: Do Nothing or Treat as Spam
3- SPF record invalid: do nothing or treat as spam
If all are do nothing, then we dont do spf checks at all.
Obviously this needs its own logging similar to the other options.
We also need to surface this in the popup to show if the SPF record was pass, fail, none, invalid
to be clear " SPF Check Fails" means we did the check, the record was there but the IP was not allowed to send.
